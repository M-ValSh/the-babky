Are you constantly working? Get what feels like a big salary, but after a couple of days you can’t figure out where it has gone? Are you jealous of the guys whose expenses can be counted to the penny by the grandmas at the porch? Do you dream of the same accurate and constant monitoring of funds? There is an exit!
